By: Braulio Reyes and Max Rego

## Structure and Implementation

For structing our project, we devided all potential features into segments, 
using the organizational tool Jira. Braulio took project lead, volenteering
to devide the features, splitting up both the front and back end sections
to give us both time to work with each. 

Our stack is a PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React with Tailwind CSS 
and Typescript, and Node.js.

For Authentication on our project, JSON Web Tokens manage access to the site.
By revoking and allowing tokens on logout and login, we allow accounts with matching
tokens access what is determined by their account. Loggin out revokes the token, requiring
a new login and new token.
